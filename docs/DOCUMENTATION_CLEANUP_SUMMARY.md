# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-05  
**Purpose**: Clean up outdated documentation and improve accuracy

## Actions Taken

### 1. Archived Completed Implementation Documents

Moved to `/docs/archived/`:
- `plumtree-design.md` - Implementation complete, now archival
- `plumtree-implementation-plan.md` - Implementation complete, now archival
- `plumtree-implementation-summary.md` - Implementation complete, now archival
- `ant-quic-integration.md` - Integration complete, now archival
- `transport-integration-summary.md` - Integration complete, now archival
- `ULTRATHINK_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation complete, now archival
- `audit.md` - Superseded by `audit-updated.md`

### 2. Updated README.md

**Fixed**: Removed "Coming Soon" labels from CLI features that are already implemented:
- Network Operations - ✅ Working
- PubSub Messaging - ✅ Working  
- Presence Beacons - ✅ Working

**Status**: CLI tool has full identity management and basic network operations

### 3. Updated SPEC2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

**Updated Progress**: From 35% to 80% complete
- Marked Coordinator Adverts as ✅ Complete (binary deployed)
- Marked Rendezvous Shards as ✅ Complete
- Updated Groups to 85% (MLS wrapper with BLAKE3 KDF)
- Marked Presence Beacons as 60% (basic implementation)
- Marked FOAF Queries as 60% (framework exists)

### 4. Current Documentation Status

#### Active Documentation (Keep)
- `README.md` - Updated with current capabilities
- `SPEC.md` - Original specification (v0.1)
- `SPEC2.md` - Current specification (v0.2, PQC-only)
- `SPEC2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Updated roadmap
- `QUICKSTART_SPEC2.md` - Implementation guide
- `COORDINATOR_FIX_PLAN.md` - Active TDD plan
- `audit-updated.md` - Current compliance status (85%)
- `saorsa-mls-0.3.0-capabilities.md` - Technical reference

#### Archived Documentation (Moved)
- All implementation plans for completed features
- Outdated audit (65% compliance)
- Integration summaries for completed work

## Project Status Summary

### Version: v0.1.3 (Production-Ready)
- ✅ 164 tests passing
- ✅ Zero compilation warnings
- ✅ Complete post-quantum cryptography
- ✅ Deployable coordinator binary
- ✅ CLI tool with identity management

### Key Achievements
1. **Post-Quantum Crypto**: ML-KEM-768 + ML-DSA-65 + ChaCha20-Poly1305
2. **QUIC Transport**: ant-quic integration with NAT traversal
3. **Coordinator System**: Bootstrap discovery with binary deployment
4. **Rendezvous Sharding**: k=16 global findability without DNS
5. **MLS Integration**: Group security with BLAKE3 KDF

### Next Steps
1. Complete Saorsa Sites implementation
2. Finish IBLT reconciliation for anti-entropy
3. Implement peer scoring and mesh gating
4. Add Bluetooth fallback for offline resilience
5. Production hardening (security audit, 100-node testing)

## Documentation Quality Improvements

- **Accuracy**: All "Coming Soon" sections removed or verified
- **Version Consistency**: All docs reference v0.1.3 appropriately
- **Archive Organization**: Completed implementation docs properly archived
- **Progress Tracking**: Implementation plan updated to reflect 80% completion

The documentation now accurately reflects the current production-ready state of the Saorsa Gossip project while maintaining clear records of the implementation journey.
